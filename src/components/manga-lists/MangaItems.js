Kirio reveals that all Battlers give presentations competing for prizes, maybe even a rise in rank, but the Magical Apparatus Battler has such a small budget they normally stand no chance, until Iruma is inspired to create fireworks. As the testing requires darkness Kirio decides they must stay at school overnight. While trying to create gunpowder Kirio reveals he has an ability to create magical barriers, the only reason he survives so many explosions. Iruma asks Amelie to loan him one of her manga so Kirio can see what a firework should look like, but she refuses, at least until she realises she would get to see real fireworks. After they successfully create fireworks they exhaust themselves with a pillow fight, utilising Iruma's dodge ability and Kirio's barriers. Kirio is later contacted by a powerful demon that can use lightning magic, revealing he is the reason Sullivan has been arrested and he has been plotting with Kirio to create a machine to destroy the school.",
